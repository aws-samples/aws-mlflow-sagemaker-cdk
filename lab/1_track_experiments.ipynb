    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of these 3 notebooks is to show how you can integrate Amazon SageMaker and MLFlow in a secured environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run successfully these notebooks, you must have prepared the infrastructure using CDK, which setups up for you the MLFlow server in an isolated VPC, a VPC for the SageMaker environment, and a SageMaker Notebook instance in the VPC SageMaker environment, where you should execute these notebooks. When running this example in the SageMaker Notebook instance provisioned via CDK, the following environmental variables are also automatically set for you via notebook lifecycle policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MLFLOWSERVER` - the URI of the MLFlow server we will use for tracking purposes. In our case, this corresponds to the `HTTP API Gateway` endpoint that exposes our MLFlow server reacheable via a `PrivateLink`\n",
    "* `SECURITY_GROUP_ID` - the ID of the security group associated with this notebook.\n",
    "* `SUBNET_ID` - the ID of the subnet associated with this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will solve a regression problem which aims to answer the question: \"what is the expected price of a house in the California area?\". The target variable is the house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install required and/or update libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, the `sagemaker` SDK version tested is `2.63.1`, while the MLFlow SDK library used is the one corresponding to our MLFlow server version, i.e., `1.18.0`"

    "### Traning script\n",
    "\n",
    "The `./source_dir/train.py` script provides all the code we need for training a SageMaker model. The training script is very similar to a training script you might run outside of SageMaker, but you can access useful properties about the training environment through various environment variables, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SM_MODEL_DIR`: A string representing the path to the directory to write model artifacts to. These artifacts are uploaded to S3 for model hosting.\n",
    "* `SM_CHANNEL_TRAIN`: A string representing the path to the directory containing data in the 'training' channel.\n",
    "* `SM_CHANNEL_TEST`: A string representing the path to the directory containing data in the 'testing' channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about training environment variables, please visit \n",
    "[SageMaker Training Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-training-toolkit).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hyperparmeters\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the `RandomForestRegressor` algorithm from the SKlearn framework. For the purpose of this exercise, we are only using a subset of hyperparameters supported by this algorithm, i.e. `n-estimators` and `min-samples-leaf`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to know more the different hyperparmeters for this algorithm, please refer to the [`RandomForestRegressor` official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is important to note that for the purpose of this excercise, we are essentially omitting completely the feature engineering step, which is an essential step in any machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MLFlow interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with the MLFlow server, we use the mlflow SDK, which allows us to set the tracking URI and the experiment name. One this initial setup is completed, we can store the parameters used (`mlflow.log_params(params)`), the model that is generated (`mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, \"model\")`) with its associated metrics (`mlflow.log_metric(f'AE-at-{str(q)}th-percentile', np.percentile(a=abs_err, q=q))`)."

    "### SKlearn container\n",

    "For this example, we use the `SKlearn` framework in script mode with SageMaker. For more information please refere to [the official documentation](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/sklearn/using_sklearn.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our training script makes use of other 3rd party libraries, i.e. `mlflow`, which are not installed by default in the `Sklearn` container SageMaker provides. However, this can be easily overcome by supplying a `requirement.txt` file in the `source_dir` folder, which then SageMaker will `pip`-install before executing the training script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric definition\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker emits every log to CLoudWatch. Since we are using scripting mode, we need to specify a metric definition object to define the format of the metric we are interested in via regex, so that SageMaker knows how to extract this metric from the CloudWatch logs of the training job.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case our custom metric is as follow\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "metric_definitions = [{'Name': 'median-AE', 'Regex': \"AE-at-50th-percentile: ([0-9.]+).*$\"}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local mode\n",
    "\n",
    "During early experimentation, and for testing that your script is bug-free, it is a good practise to run SageMaker in `local` mode with a small amount of data. When you specify the `instance_type='local'`, you are instructing the SageMaker SDK to run the training on your local machine rather then in the SageMaker remote managed infrastructure. This approach makes it quicker to address problems while developing your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are confident that your code is correct, you can then offload the training to the SageMaker managed infrastructure. We will see this in the second notebook."
